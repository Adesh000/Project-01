# Street Style Landing Page

In this project, HTML was already written by mentors I was asked to do the CSS part.
I enjoyed a lot during this assignment and learned some concepts of CSS. This was my first
project that's why I took approx. 8 hours to finish this. I was stuck
while working with flex-box. I have taken video lectures for these concepts
on Learn Code Online. 


## Lessons Learned

In this project, I have explored some CSS properties listed below :-

- Selectors
    - Class and Id Selector
    - child Selector
    - Pseudo Class Selector

- Flex-box
- font properties
- color
- margin & padding
- border
